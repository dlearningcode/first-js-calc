# JavaScript Calculator

I asked Bing to give me five starter projects to practice and hone my JavaScript skills. This is one of them:

> A calculator: This project will help you practice working with numbers, operators, and user input. You can use HTML elements to create buttons for the digits and operations, and a display area for the result. You can use JavaScript to add event listeners to the buttons, and perform the calculations using the eval() function or your own logic.

My plan is to create the buttons, then add onclick triggers that add the string value of each key to a variable and display it in the display.

When the user hits one of the operators, that saves the operator for a switch case

2023-11-04 Got the basic functionality. Was calling functions from the event listener rather than references; that hung me up for about two hours to diagnose.

Now, I have to make the screen clear and update properly for all the keys and operations. then it's figuring out how to refactor for tons of repetition. And style, of course.
