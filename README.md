# JavaScript Calculator

I asked Bing to give me five starter projects to practice and hone my JavaScript skills. This is one of them:

> A calculator: This project will help you practice working with numbers, operators, and user input. You can use HTML elements to create buttons for the digits and operations, and a display area for the result. You can use JavaScript to add event listeners to the buttons, and perform the calculations using the eval() function or your own logic.

I have taken a couple courses in JavaScript as part of front end development bootcamps and certificate courses, and I watched a couple calendar app YouTube videos, but there is no copy and paste here. I coded it from scratch based on my own pseudo code.

I have all the functionality nailed and refactored to the best I'm currently able. I'm no artist, so leaving the CSS where it is. The result display grows to accommodate large numbers.

Hope you get ideas or inspiration from it! Likely one day I'll get inspiration from your work.
